## Requirements Traceability

Each requirement and specification in this document set has been assigned a unique identifier using the following format:

- **FR**: Functional Requirement
- **TS**: Technical Specification
- **MAR**: Mobile Application Requirement
- **EC**: Environmental Constraint
- **SR**: Safety Requirement
- **IA**: Integration Architecture

These identifiers enable traceability throughout the development process and facilitate verification that all requirements have been implemented and tested.

## Test Anchors

Throughout the specification documents, test anchors have been included to guide the development of test cases and validation procedures. These anchors are formatted as:

```
// TEST: Description of what should be tested
```

These test anchors serve as reminders for verification activities and help ensure that all critical aspects of the system are properly tested.

## Next Steps

After review and approval of this specification, the following steps are recommended:

1. Develop detailed design documents based on these specifications
2. Create test plans aligned with the test anchors
3. Implement proof-of-concept prototypes for critical subsystems
4. Conduct design reviews with key stakeholders
5. Refine specifications based on prototype results and stakeholder feedback

## Document Maintenance

This specification set should be treated as a living document and updated as the project evolves. All changes should be tracked and communicated to relevant stakeholders. Regular reviews should be conducted to ensure the specification remains accurate and complete.
