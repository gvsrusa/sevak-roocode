# Sevak Mini Tractor: Pseudocode Index

## Overview

This directory contains pseudocode modules that outline the high-level algorithms and logic for key components of the Sevak mini tractor system. These pseudocode modules serve as a bridge between the requirements and the actual implementation, providing a clear structure for future coding and testing.

## Pseudocode Modules

### 1. [Autonomous Navigation](autonomous_navigation.md)

The autonomous navigation module contains pseudocode for the following components:

- **Navigation System Architecture**: Hierarchical structure of the navigation system
- **Localization Module**: Algorithms for determining the tractor's position and orientation
- **Path Planning Module**: Algorithms for generating optimal paths between waypoints
- **Obstacle Detection and Avoidance**: Algorithms for detecting and avoiding obstacles
- **Motion Control Module**: Algorithms for controlling the tractor's movement
- **Autonomous Operation Coordinator**: High-level coordination of autonomous operations

### 2. [Fodder Operations](fodder_operations.md)

The fodder operations module contains pseudocode for the following components:

- **Fodder Operations System Architecture**: Structure of the fodder operations system
- **Cutting System Module**: Algorithms for controlling the fodder cutting operations
- **Loading System Module**: Algorithms for managing the fodder loading operations
- **Transport System Module**: Algorithms for managing the fodder transport operations
- **Fodder Operations Coordinator**: Coordination between cutting, loading, and transport operations

### 3. [Mobile App Integration](mobile_app_integration.md)

The mobile app integration module contains pseudocode for the following components:

- **Mobile App Architecture**: Layered architecture of the mobile application
- **Communication Layer**: Algorithms for handling connectivity with the tractor
- **Operation Control Module**: Algorithms for managing tractor operations from the mobile app
- **Data Synchronization Module**: Algorithms for synchronizing data between the app and tractor
- **User Interface Integration**: Integration of the UI with the underlying control systems

## Test Anchors

Throughout the pseudocode modules, test anchors have been included to guide the development of test cases. These anchors are formatted as:

```
// TEST: Description of what should be tested
```

These test anchors serve as reminders for verification activities and help ensure that all critical aspects of the system are properly tested.

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing the actual code based on this pseudocode:

1. **Modular Implementation**: Implement each module independently with clear interfaces
2. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling to all functions
3. **Logging**: Implement detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
4. **Configuration**: Make constants and thresholds configurable
5. **Testing**: Develop tests based on the provided test anchors
6. **Documentation**: Document all implemented functions and classes

## Next Steps

After review and approval of this pseudocode:

1. Develop detailed technical design documents based on this pseudocode
2. Create test plans aligned with the test anchors
3. Implement proof-of-concept prototypes for critical algorithms
4. Conduct design reviews with key stakeholders
5. Refine the pseudocode based on prototype results and stakeholder feedback
