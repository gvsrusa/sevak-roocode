# Sevak Mini Tractor Project Overview

## Project Background
The Sevak mini tractor is an autonomous electric agricultural vehicle designed specifically for small-scale farmers in rural India. It aims to address labor shortages, increase farming efficiency, and reduce the environmental impact of agricultural operations through electric power and smart automation.

## Project Goals
1. Develop an affordable, autonomous electric mini tractor suitable for small-scale farming operations
2. Enable efficient fodder cutting, loading, and transport capabilities
3. Provide intuitive remote control through a mobile application
4. Ensure reliable operation in rural Indian environments with limited infrastructure
5. Implement comprehensive safety features and fail-safes
6. Create seamless integration between hardware and software systems

## Target Users
- Small-scale farmers in rural India with 1-5 acres of land
- Farmers with limited access to labor or conventional farming equipment
- Users with basic smartphone literacy but potentially limited technical expertise
- Agricultural cooperatives sharing equipment among multiple small farms

## Project Scope
### In Scope
- Autonomous electric mini tractor hardware design specifications
- Fodder cutting, loading, and transport mechanisms
- Mobile application for remote control and monitoring
- Safety systems and fail-safes
- Hardware-software integration architecture
- Environmental adaptations for rural Indian deployment

### Out of Scope
- Mass production manufacturing processes
- Distribution and sales channels
- Detailed component-level engineering specifications
- Regulatory certification processes (though requirements will be noted)
- Training and support systems (though requirements will be noted)

## Key Stakeholders
- Small-scale farmers (end users)
- Agricultural extension workers
- Rural development agencies
- Environmental sustainability organizations
- Agricultural engineering teams
- Software development teams
- Hardware manufacturing partners

## Success Criteria
1. Tractor can autonomously navigate predefined routes with 95% accuracy
2. Fodder cutting and loading operations achieve 80% efficiency compared to manual methods
3. Battery life supports at least 4 hours of continuous operation
4. Mobile app can be effectively used by farmers with basic smartphone literacy
5. System operates reliably in temperatures ranging from 5°C to 45°C
6. All safety features function correctly in 99.9% of test scenarios
7. Total cost of ownership is 30% lower than equivalent diesel-powered equipment over 5 years

## Constraints
1. Limited internet connectivity in deployment areas
2. Variable power supply quality for charging
3. Rough terrain and unpredictable environmental conditions
4. Cost constraints for target market affordability
5. Limited technical expertise of end users
6. Spare parts availability in rural areas
7. Regulatory requirements for autonomous agricultural equipment
