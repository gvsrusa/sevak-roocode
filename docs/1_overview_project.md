## Introduction

The Sevak mini tractor is an autonomous electric agricultural vehicle designed specifically for small-scale farmers in rural India. It aims to address labor shortages, increase farming efficiency, and reduce the environmental impact of agricultural operations through electric power and smart automation.

This comprehensive documentation set provides detailed information about the Sevak mini tractor, including technical specifications, user guides, setup instructions, security features, maintenance procedures, troubleshooting steps, developer documentation, and API references.

## Project Purpose

The Sevak mini tractor project addresses several critical challenges faced by small-scale farmers in rural India:

1. **Labor Shortages**: Autonomous operation reduces dependency on manual labor
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Electric power and smart operations lower operational costs
3. **Environmental Sustainability**: Zero emissions and minimal soil compaction
4. **Precision Agriculture**: Consistent and accurate fodder operations
5. **Accessibility**: Designed for farmers with limited technical expertise
6. **Adaptability**: Functions in areas with limited infrastructure

## Target Users

The Sevak mini tractor is designed primarily for:

- Small-scale farmers in rural India with 1-5 acres of land
