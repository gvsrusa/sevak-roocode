# Sevak Mini Tractor Codebase Optimization

This document outlines the optimizations made to the Sevak mini tractor codebase to improve performance, maintainability, and resource efficiency.

## 1. Monitoring System Optimizations

### 1.1 Data Management Improvements

#### Tiered Data Storage
- Implemented a three-tier data storage system:
  - **Recent data**: High-resolution raw metrics for the last hour
  - **Hourly data**: Aggregated metrics with hourly resolution (7 days retention)
  - **Daily data**: Aggregated metrics with daily resolution (full retention period)

#### Data Aggregation
- Added automatic aggregation of metrics to reduce storage requirements
- Implemented intelligent data retention policies based on age and importance
- Added min/max/average calculations for numerical metrics

#### Memory Optimization
- Reduced memory footprint by trimming recent metrics to a configurable retention period
- Implemented automatic cleanup of old data to prevent memory leaks
- Added batch processing for metrics collection to reduce CPU spikes

### 1.2 Performance Improvements

- Added caching for frequently accessed metrics
- Optimized data rotation to reduce file I/O operations
- Improved metrics collection frequency based on importance
- Added compression for stored metrics data

## 2. Mobile App Interface Optimizations

### 2.1 Communication Efficiency

#### Message Compression
- Added automatic compression for large messages (>1KB)
- Implemented client capability detection for compression support
- Added fallback mechanism for clients without compression support

#### Message Batching
- Implemented message batching for broadcasts to reduce network overhead
- Added a configurable batching window (50ms) to balance latency and throughput
- Created a batch message type to handle multiple messages in a single transmission

#### Status Caching
- Added caching for status requests to reduce redundant system queries
- Implemented configurable TTL (Time-To-Live) for cached status data
- Added automatic cache invalidation for critical status changes

### 2.2 Resource Management

- Improved client connection handling with proper cleanup
- Added better error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Optimized shutdown sequence to ensure proper resource cleanup
- Implemented more efficient event handling

## 3. General Optimizations

### 3.1 Memory Usage

- Reduced memory footprint through more efficient data structures
- Implemented proper cleanup of resources when no longer needed
- Added memory usage monitoring and optimization

### 3.2 Error Handling and Recovery

- Enhanced error detection and reporting
- Added graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Improved logging with appropriate severity levels

### 3.3 Startup and Shutdown

- Optimized initialization sequence to reduce startup time
- Improved shutdown procedure to ensure proper resource cleanup
- Added better handling of unexpected termination

## 4. Best Practices

### 4.1 Code Organization

- Modularized code for better maintainability
- Improved separation of concerns
- Enhanced documentation for critical components

### 4.2 Performance Monitoring

- Added performance metrics collection
- Implemented automatic detection of performance bottlenecks
- Added reporting mechanisms for performance issues

### 4.3 Resource Efficiency

- Optimized CPU usage through better algorithms
- Reduced memory consumption through more efficient data structures
- Minimized network traffic through compression and batching

## 5. Future Optimization Opportunities
